### The Problem

Every year, millions of tourists buy reusable items like bottles, bags, and utensils during their travels â€” only to leave them behind when they move on. These perfectly usable items often end up in the trash or left behind in hotels, adding to waste and missing the chance to benefit another traveler. A viscious cycle is created where retailers are incentized to only make cheaper and less sustainable products, further dissuading tourists from sustainable use. 

### The Solution

Our online platform **Waypost** addresses the concerning rise of single use items by promoting a circular economy that is beneficial for tourists, local businesses, travel retailers, and the planet! Products from partnering retailers are tracked via QR code and a secure Firestore database, allowing the buyer to drop it off at a participating local business, giving it a second life with another tourist. In return, each donation earns the user points that discount future purchases, rewarding sustainable practice, while the businesses and retailers benefit from valuable promotion, marketing, and customer trust.
